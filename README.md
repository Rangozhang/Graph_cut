# Graph_cut
A simple implementation of graph cut algorithm with color and gradient constraints.

Graph cut algorithm requires users to put strokes on processing images. For some purposes of my project, the inputs are source image and markup image which are all stored in "/images" and "/images_s" respectively. The "weight" bar is for tunning weights of color and gradient constriants. The code uses "graph" and "maxflow" code by Vladimimr Kolmogorov in http://www.adastral.ucl.ac.uk/~vladkolm/software.html

The code is according to Google style for cpp. (trying to..)
